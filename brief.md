# Associate Software Engineer Technical Test

## Introduction

As part of our regulatory requirements we are required to audit many different aspects of our business. Many of these aspects are financial, however many are not.

An example of an audit that we must perform regularly is to verify that everyone who has an account in our IT identity database also has a corresponding record in our HR systems.

## Task

Write a simple program that processes two datafeeds (one in CSV, one in JSON) and produces lists of individuals who are only present in one of the lists. The output should be a single CSV which has the email address, full name of employee and a note identifying which list the user is present in.

Please use any development techniques that you would use to write production code, you are free to use any language you wish.

## Written Question

Imagine that you are building a system that is responsible for performing many different audits at automated periodic intervals (such as hourly, daily and monthly), these audits will often require fetching multiple different data feeds and then processing, producing a report and forwarding onwards.

Describe how you would approach building a piece of software to do this? What technologies would you use?

Please explain your answers and justify your choices, feel free to make assumptions and state them, and less than 500 words in total please.
